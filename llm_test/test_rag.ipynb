Therefore, in the context of a decelerating economy, declining inflation, and tight spreads in both US and European credit, we are reducing our exposure to high yield. Additionally, in response to changes in rate expectations and the recent increase in yields, portfolio duration is being increased to levels around 5-7 years by adding to sovereign bond exposure across currencies. Investment grade spreads remain attractive and therefore we maintain our overweight position.\n",
