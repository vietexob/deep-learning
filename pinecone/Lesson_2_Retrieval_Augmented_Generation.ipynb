However the word \"algebra\" is a Latin form of the Arabic word Al-Jabr (\"casting\") and comes from a mathematics book Al-Maqala fi Hisab-al Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah, (\"Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation\") written in the 9th century by a Persian mathematician, Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, who was a Muslim born in Khwarizm in Uzbekistan. He flourished under Al-Ma'moun in Baghdad, Iraq through 813-833 AD, and died around 840 AD. The book was brought into Europe and translated into Latin in the 12th century. The book was then given the name 'Algebra'. (The ending of the mathematician's name, al-Khwarizmi, was changed into a word easier to say in Latin, and became the English word algorithm).\n",

      "In the 10th century, the local Ghaznavids turned Ghazni into their capital and firmly established Islam throughout all areas of Afghanistan, except the Kafiristan region in the northeast. Mahmud of Ghazni, a great Ghaznavid sultan, conquered the Multan and Punjab region, and carried raids into the heart of India. Mohammed bin Abdul Jabbar Utbi (Al-Utbi), a historian from the 10th century, wrote that thousands of \"Afghans\" were in the Ghaznavid army. The Ghaznavid dynasty was replaced by the Ghorids of Ghor in the late 12th century, who reconquered Ghaznavid territory in the name of Islam and ruled it until 1206. The Ghorid army also included ethnic Afghans.\n",

The early Persian poets such as Rudaki were from what is now Afghanistan. Moreover, Ferdowsi, the author of Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran, and Rumi, the famous Sufi poet, were also from modern-day Afghanistan. It has produced scientists such as Avicenna, Al-Farabi, Al-Biruni, Omar Khayyám, Al-Khwarizmi, and many others who are widely known for their important contributions in areas such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, physics, geography, and geology.

      "Farmers and herders settled in the plains surrounding the Hindu Kush as early as 7000 B.C. These people may have grown rich off the lapis lazuli they found along riverbeds, which they traded to early city sites to the west, across the Iranian plateau and Mesopotamia. As farms and villages grew and thrived in Afghanistan, these ancient people eventually invented irrigation (digging ditches for water so it flows to crops) that allowed them to grow crops on the northern Afghanistan desert plains. This civilization (advanced state of organization) is today called BMAC (Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex), or the \"Oxus civilization\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The Oxus civilization expanded as far east as western edge of the Indus Valley during the period between 2200 and 1800 B.C. These people, who were the ancestors of the Indo-Aryans, used the term \"Aryan\" to identify their ethnicity, culture, and religion. Scholars know this when they read the ancient texts of these people; the Avesta of Iranic peoples and the Vedas of Indo-Aryans.\n",

      "The Babylon Gate, also known as the Ishtar Gate, was a monumental entrance to the ancient city of Babylon, located in present-day Iraq. It was built during the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar II in the 6th century BCE and was considered one of the most impressive architectural achievements of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gate was part of a larger project to rebuild the city of Babylon, which had been destroyed by the Assyrians. It was constructed using glazed bricks, with intricate designs and images of animals and gods adorning its walls. The gate was dedicated to the goddess Ishtar, the patron deity of Babylon, and was meant to impress and intimidate visitors with its grandeur and power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Babylon Gate was not only a symbol of the city's wealth and strength, but it also served as a defensive structure. The gate was part of a larger wall that surrounded the city, and its imposing size and design were meant to deter any potential invaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gate was also an important religious site, as it was believed to be the place where the gods entered and exited the city. It was a popular destination for pilgrims and was often used for religious ceremonies and processions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the Babylon Gate, along with the rest of the city, fell into ruin over time. It was eventually excavated by German archaeologist Robert Koldewey in the early 20th century, and many of its original bricks and decorations were discovered and reconstructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the Babylon Gate is considered one of the most significant archaeological finds in the world. Its intricate design and historical significance have made it a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from all over the world to marvel at its beauty and learn about the ancient city of Babylon. \n"
